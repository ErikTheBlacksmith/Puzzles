# Puzzles
Here you can find a repository of puzzles and the sort which I enjoyed and/or think is worthwhile sharing.

For example, I completed the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) for 2022, and probably will in the future. This folder was initially created for it, but was never uploaded because while they were enjoyable, I don't believe that any of the days were fun enough or required enough ingenuity. Nothing against the advent. I recommend it (although I don't recommend staying up until midnight for the leaderboard haha)

I'm always on the lookout for more of these sorts of things, so let me know if you find any online, from a textbook, etc.
